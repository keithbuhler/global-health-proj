  According to Feeding America’s most recent report from 2012, about 800,000 people in Cook County are food insecure. Food insecurity is the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. Poor nutrition leads to a number of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes which can be fatal if not treated.

    When you compare this map to the two maps showing populations in Chicago having heart disease and diabetes, you can see that the areas with higher food insecurity tend to have higher prevalence of the two chronic diseases.
